## Project overview

The project is to consist of R code in your
group's project folder on GitHub and 
documentation submitted as a PDF file 
to a Crowdmark assessment. The code and documentation
are due at 11:59pm on Tuesday April 20.

### Code on GitHub (40 marks)

1. (2 marks) A README.md file should include your 
group members' names and a list of the files in your 
project folder, with a short description of the
contents of each file.

2. (13 marks) The main `mars.R` file should
include the `mars()` function and any others,
such as `fwd_stepwise()`, that are called by `mars()`.
Arrange your functions in a "top-down" manner,
with higher-level functions appearing first,
followed by successive levels of lower-level functions.
You are graded on the following criteria:
    * Data structures (2). The input data
    structures should be a formula, data and `mars.control`
    object. The output data structure is an S3 object
    of class `mars` that inherits from class `lm`.
    * Correctness (5). There should be no errors in the code and
    it should correctly implement MARS (see *Test suite* below).
    * Readability (4): The steps and logic of your implementation
    should be clearly layed out. It should be easy 
    for someone else in the class to read your code 
    and understand what is going on.
    * Efficiency (2): Take steps to avoid computational
    inefficiencies, such as excessive copying of 
    large R objects.

3. (15 marks) User interface (methods).
Include one file for each method you implement for
MARS objects. 
The criteria for the user interface are:
    * Correct (4 marks). All methods work correctly.
    * Comprehensive (5 marks). You should implement
    `anova()`, `plot()`, `predict()`, `print()` and `summary()` 
    methods for `mars` objects. 
    (You can use the implementations of `residuals()` and
    `fitted()` that you inherit from the `lm` class.)
    * Familiar (4 marks). The user interface should
    look familiar to someone who has used `lm()` and `glm()`.
    * Use your creativity (2 marks). This is the part of the
    project where you can combine your skills as an R 
    programmer and data analyst. What features would help
    users gain insight into their data and the fitted
    model? Think of something we have not discussed
    as a class and implement it. (**Note** I haven't thought of
    anything myself and may remove this part of the rubric.)


4. (10 marks) Test suite. A file `test.R` that
includes at least three worked examples with 
non-trivial data. The examples should show a user
how to call `mars()` and illustrate the methods that
you have written for MARS objects (see *User interface* above). Computations
for each example should take no more than one minute.
I will provide one example dataset that the project marker
will use to verify that your code works correctly.
You should provide at least two other examples.
The criteria for the test suite are:
    * Correct (4 marks). All examples run without errors.
    * Comprehensive (4 marks). Taken together, the examples
    should illustrate **all** of your functions/methods.
    * Interesting (2 marks). Use the most interesting
    data you can find. Trivial examples will get no marks.

### Documentation (20 marks)

The documentation is for your `mars()` function and should include the following sections. The sections are those of a typical R documentation file. See the help file for the `lm()` function
for an example and [Section 2.1.1 of the Writing R Extensions Manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Documenting-functions) for further details. (The manual is
really too much detail for your project, but I provide 
the link in case you are interested.)
You can write the documentation using a word processor
or RMarkdown, or have the documentation generated
from roxygen2 comments in your source file. 
If you go the roxygen2 route, you may need to copy the
help file to HTML for printing; e.g., from an R session
with your documentation directory as working directory,
issue the following R commands:

```
sink("mars.html"); tools::Rd2HTML("mars.Rd"); sink()
```

1. (2 marks) Description (brief) -- a one- or two-line description of what the function does 
2. (1 mark) Usage -- how to call the function
3. (2 marks) Arguments -- a list of arguments and their meaning
4. (5 marks) Details -- a precise and detailed description of what the function does
5. (3 marks) Value -- a description of the function's return value
6. (1 mark) Author(s) -- your name(s)
7. (1 mark) References -- a reference to the Friedman paper and any other sources you think are necessary
8. (2 marks) See Also -- a brief description of the methods written for MARS objects
9. (3 marks) Examples -- Three complete examples of how to use your function and the methods written for its output. You can use examples from your test suite (see *Test suite* above).
