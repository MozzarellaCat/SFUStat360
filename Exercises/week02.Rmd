```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Predict the outcome of the following:
```
c(1, FALSE)
c("a",1)
c(list(1),"a")
c(TRUE,1)
```

2. If `vv <- list(a=1,b=2)`, why doesn't `as.vector(vv)`
work to coerce `vv` into an atomic vector?

3. What do `dim()`, `nrow()` and `ncol()` return when applied to a 1-dimensional vector? What about `NROW()` or `NCOL()`?

4. What is `dim(cbind(A,A))` if `A = matrix(1:4,2,2)`?

5. What do the following return? Understand why. 
```
TRUE | FALSE
c(TRUE,TRUE) & c(FALSE,TRUE)
c(TRUE,TRUE) && c(FALSE,TRUE)
```

6. What sort of object does `table()` return? What is its type? What attributes does it have? How does the dimensionality change as you tabulate more variables?

7. What happens to a factor when you modify its levels?
How do f2 and f3 differ from f1?

```
f1 <- factor(letters)
levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
f2 <- rev(factor(letters))
f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
```

8. Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:
```
mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
mtcars[-1:4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]
```

9. Consider the following data frame and tibble. Suppose
you want to extract the number from the first row and first column and 
multiply this number by the vector `1:3`. How would
you do this for the data frame? How would you do this
for the tibble?
```
dd <- data.frame(x=1:3,y=c("a","b","c))
tt <- as.tibble(dd)
```
